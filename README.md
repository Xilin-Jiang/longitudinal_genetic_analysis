# longitudinal_genetic_analysis

####This code describe how to estimate genetic risk with the interval-censored proportionaal hazard model.

The file [Genetic_longitudinal_functions.R](https://github.com/Xilin-Jiang/longitudinal_genetic_analysis/blob/main/Genetic_longitudinal_functions.R "Genetic_longitudinal_functions.R") has all functions needed for simulating disease event over age, and performing proportional hazard model analysis on over the simulated population. 

The file [simulation_for_paper.R](https://github.com/Xilin-Jiang/longitudinal_genetic_analysis/blob/main/simulation_for_paper.R "simulation_for_paper.R") contains the code for the simulation shown in the paper. Though we recommend saparating blocks for submission to clusters.
